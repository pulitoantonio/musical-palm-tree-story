There once was a dog named Billy. Billy was white with brown spots. He loved to go outside.

Billy went outside. Way outside. Billy ended up in New York City.

Not understanding the local laws and customs, Billy ordered New York Style pizza at an obvious mob-front restaurant. He was promptly shot and killed by famous mafia enforcer(s) Joe Pesci and Ray Liotta.

Billy's family couldn't believe the unfortunate news. Maybe more about the fact that Billy walked hundreds of miles in a span of a few hours.

In Billy's hometown of Madison, a statue was put up to remember him and his great achievements.
